For - One type of loop that can repeat an action many times. A for loop has 3 main types of information: where to start, when to stop, and how to get to the next item. For loops are used more than any other type so they are very important!

i.e. 
for (start, stop, step) {
   do something
}

=============================================
&&, ||, ! - These are operators that can be used to create and/or test more powerful logical expressions. && (And) is used to combine 2 logical expressions. || (Or) is used to determine something about one OR a second expression. ! means NOT.   

i.e. 
a && b - returns true if both a and b are true
a || b - returns true if either a or b is true
!a - returns opposite of a (returns opposite value, for example if a is true, then false will be returned)

=============================================
Arrays - A data structure that holds more than one value. Think of an array as a list of items (elements) and they can be identified by an index (index always starts at 0] .

i.e. 
colors = [red, green, blue, purple];

colors has 3 items
colors[0] = red

==============================================
